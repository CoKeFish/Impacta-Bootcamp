One-liner

The simplest way to organize group trips and manage shared budgets with blockchain escrow.

Problem

When we plan trips with friends, coordinating budgets, collecting money, and enforcing payment deadlines is messy and
stressful. We end up using chats and spreadsheets, which creates trust issues, late payments, disputes, and complicated
cancellations/refunds when someone drops out often causing the whole trip to fail and everyone to lose time, money, and
good booking deals.

Audience (Segments)

1. Friend groups (18 to 35): planning trips together who need an easy, drama-free way to collect and manage
   contributions.
2. Trip organizers / group leaders who coordinate budgets, deadlines, and rules, and want full transparency for
   everyone.
3. Repeat group travelers: graduation trips, festivals, weekend getaways, who plan multiple group trips per year.
4. Partner businesses: hotels, restaurants, transportation, tours, who would pay for exposure, commissions, or promo
   deals to attract large groups.

Solution

We provide a group trip planning platform that uses a smart contract to collect everyone’s contributions toward a shared
budget, track payment milestones transparently, and enforce fair rules if someone drops out. Once the group reaches the
target amount and minimum participants, the funds are held in a shared wallet and can be used to pay travel services
through partner discounts or withdrawn/exported to other wallets.

Unique Value Proposition

We make group trips easy and trustworthy by automating shared payments with a smart contract: everyone sees progress in
real time, rules are enforced fairly if someone drops out, and the group unlocks partner travel discounts once the
budget is reached.

Market

Group travel is a massive, recurring market driven by friends and family planning trips together especially for weekend
getaways, vacations, and milestone events. Our reachable slice is digitally active travelers, students, and young
professionals, who already split costs via apps but still struggle with dropouts, unclear commitments, and trust. We’ll
start locally (one country/city cluster), partner with hotels/transport/restaurants for discounts, and grow by targeting
groups organizing mid-to-large budgets where coordination and payment enforcement matter most.

Why Now

Now is the right time because group travel is booming again, but people expect instant, digital-first coordination and
transparent money handling. Wallets and smart contracts have matured enough to automate group commitments, milestones,
refunds, and penalties without needing everyone to “trust the organizer.” At the same time, travel businesses are
actively looking for new distribution channels and are more willing to offer discounts and partnerships to platforms
that bring verified group demand.

Moat (Defensibility)

1. A trusted on-chain coordination and escrow system that reliably handles group budgets, milestones, and automated
   refunds.
2. Network effects as more groups and partner businesses join, improving discounts and availability.
3. Proprietary data on group travel intent and payment reliability that improves matching and pricing.
4. Integrations and partnerships with hotels, transport, and restaurants that become harder for new entrants to
   replicate as our volume and performance history expand.

Go-to-Market

We’ll start with friend group travel organizers at universities and workplaces, using social sharing as the main growth
loop: one person creates a trip, invites friends via link/WhatsApp, and the group onboards to contribute to the shared
budget. We’ll drive initial demand through campus ambassadors, partnerships with travel creators, short-form content
showing “group trip budgeting made easy”, and referral rewards for trip creators. To convert, we’ll offer a free tier
for smaller groups/budgets and charge on larger budgets or high-member trips, plus take partner commissions when users
book hotels/transport/restaurants through in-app offers. We’ll expand city by city by signing local partners and
highlighting exclusive discounts to increase close rates.

Business Model

1. Transaction/platform fees (only on big trips): we charge a small fee when a trip reaches a high total budget or has
   many participants. Smaller trips can stay free to drive adoption.
2. Partner commissions (B2B2C): we partner with hotels, transport providers, restaurants, and experiences. When groups
   pay for services through our platform, we earn a commission or referral fee.
3. Premium partner placement (optional): businesses can pay for featured offers or boosted visibility inside trip
   recommendations (without harming user trust).

How funds flow:

Participants contribute money toward shared milestones. Once the goal is met, funds are held in the platform wallet and
can be used to pay partner services directly or exported to external wallets, while the smart contract enforces rules,
minimum group size, refunds, and rebalancing if someone drops.

Economics

1. Blockchain / smart contract costs: development, audits, and ongoing maintenance, plus network fees for contract
   interactions and payouts.
2. Wallet & custody infrastructure: secure key management, transaction monitoring, and compliance-grade storage, even if
   users can export funds.
3. Payment rails & on/off ramps: fees for card/bank processing, settlement, chargebacks, and currency conversion.
4. Platform engineering: backend, mobile/web apps, databases, scalability, uptime, and integrations with travel
   providers.
5. Security & risk: fraud prevention, dispute handling, and penetration testing.
6. Customer support & operations: handling refunds, user dropouts, trip cancellations, and partner service issues.
7. Partner acquisition & account management: sales effort, contracts, onboarding, and maintaining discounts/offers.
8. Marketing & user acquisition: influencers, referral incentives, community programs, and paid campaigns.

Traction & Metrics

1. Active groups created per week and percent that reach the minimum group size (4+ people).
2. Funding progress rate: average time for a group to reach 25%, 50%, and 100% of the target budget.
3. Total value locked (TVL) in group trip wallets and net deposits versus withdrawals.
4. Contribution completion rate: percent of members who finish their full contribution (e.g., 1M COP).
5. Dropout rate and refund events (how often people leave and how smoothly settlements happen).
6. Trip completion rate: percent of groups that actually book services after hitting the goal.
7. Bookings GMV (total spend through partners) and take rate or revenue per trip.
8. Partner traction: number of active partners, offers live, and conversion to partner bookings.
9. Retention: users or groups that start a second trip within 60 to 90 days.
10. User satisfaction: support tickets per 100 trips, and dispute rate.

Fundraising

1. We are raising to build and launch the first production version of the group-trip smart contract, wallet custody
   layer, and partner booking marketplace.
2. We are looking for pre-seed or seed funding to cover 12 to 18 months of runway and reach a live pilot with real
   travel bookings.
3. We will use funds for engineering (smart contracts, backend, security, mobile/web), product design, and compliance
   and risk management.
4. We will allocate budget to partnerships and operations to onboard hotels, transport, and restaurants and manage
   discounts and settlements.
5. We will invest in go-to-market experiments, referrals, and community growth to acquire the first recurring trip
   groups.
6. We will reserve funding for audits, monitoring, and legal work to ensure safe handling of pooled funds and
   transparent refunds.
